# 💻 ss.lv-parser
____
I created a parser for personal use 🤓. I was curious and wanted to explore my interests, so I made it!
### 💡 Simple instructions
At the start, you'll be asked 3 questions:
### 🔗 Please insert link;
To insert the link to the catalog, just enter the full form along with "https://www." For example: https://www.ss.com/en/electronics/phones/mobile-phones/apple/sell/
![console](https://github.com/FR13NDS2020/ss.lv-parser/blob/main/assets/in_console.png)
### 🔧 print 0 or 1 if you want to enable filter for videocards:
Just press enter to choose the default option (0). This option removes all letters, leaving only numbers, which can sometimes come in handy!
### 🔍 select parameter:
Here, you just need to select the parameter by which the calculation will be made.
