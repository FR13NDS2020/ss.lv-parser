# 💻 ss.lv-parser
I created a parser for personal use 🤓. I was curious and wanted to explore my interests, so I made it!

### 💡 Simple instructions
At the start, you'll be asked 3 questions:

### 🔗 Please insert link;
To insert the link to the catalog, just enter the full form along with "https://www." For example: https://www.ss.com/en/electronics/phones/mobile-phones/apple/sell/

### 🔧 print 0 or 1 if you want to enable filter for videocards:
Just press enter to choose the default option (0). This option removes all letters, leaving only numbers, which can sometimes come in handy!

### 🔍 select parameter:
Here, you just need to select the parameter by which the calculation will be made.
